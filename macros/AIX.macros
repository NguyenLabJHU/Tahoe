# NOTE: with optimization level 03, found that some benchmarks did not

#       spectral decompositions of a symmetric rank 2 tensor. For some
#       reason, these routines were sensitive to the level of optimitzation.
#       See the class toolbox/src/misc/SpectralDecompT. Even higher levels
#       of optimization were not tested.
