1. FEDEManagerT

FEDEManagerT::Solve() overidden to include DemComputeStep() and GhostDisplaceStep().

FEDEManagerT::SolveStep() overridden to take into account ghost particle contributions.
   status = fSolvers[fCurrentGroup]->Solve(iter, *this, fGhostFBC);

FEDEManagerT::FormRHS() overridden to take into account fGhostFBC.

2. SolverT::Solve() overloaded to be an interface which can accept both fFEDEManager and fGhostFBC.
	virtual SolutionStatusT Solve(int max_iterations, FEDEManagerT&	fFEDEManager, ArrayT<FBC_CardT>& fGhostFBC) {};

3. LinearSolver::Solve() overloaded to take into account both fGhostFBC and fFBC, using fFEDEManager and fFEManager respectively.
	/* initialize */
	fRHS = 0.0;
			
	/* form the residual force vector from ghost particles */
	fFEDEManager.FormRHS(Group(), fGhostFBC);

	/* form the residual force vector */
	fFEManager.FormRHS(Group());

4. NLSolver::Solve() overloaded to take into account both fGhostFBC and fFBC, using fFEDEManager and fFEManager respectively.
	fRHS = 0.0;
	fFEDEManager.FormRHS(Group(), fGhostFBC);
	fFEManager.FormRHS(Group());

5. NodeManagerT::FormRHS() overloaded to assemble only ghost particle contributions to the residual force.

6. FieldT::FormRHS() overloaded to assemble only ghost particle contributions to the residual force.

7. FBC_CardT adds memeber functions: ClearValues(), AddValues(), Value().
