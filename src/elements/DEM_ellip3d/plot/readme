Note:
1. The commonly used codes have adopted Tecplot transient data format.
2. Use plot3 deposit_particle 99 99 1 rather than plot3 deposit_particle_099, because the former syntax produces accurate SOLUTIONTIME for Tecplot transient data format.
3. To compile, use default g++ (do not load modules) so that the executable is usable without loading modules.

plot:  
it plots all particles at a time as a snapshot. Animations can be made by combining snapshots.
There are various versions: 
1. plot:  for data format from ellip3d and ellip3d-2.0.
2. plot3: for data format from paraEllip3d.
3. plot4: for data format from merged version of paraEllip3d and paraPolyEllip3d.

plotsec:
it plots half of all particles from a cross-sectional perspective. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plotmz:  
it plots each particle as a zone.

plot1pc: (plot-1-particle-contacting) 
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots, however, it plots a neighour only when the neighbour is in contact with
it, so a neighbour may first appear and  then disappear in animation.

plot1pp: (plot-1-particle-possible)
it plots a particle and its possible neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plot1pmz: (plot-1-particle-multiple_zones)
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot, each particle being a zone.

plotvec: 
it plots vectors such as force and velocity.

plotcontact:
it plots normal and tangential force vectors at contacts.

probe1p:
it extracts a particle's information.

probedual:
it extracts contact info between two particles.

plotpile, plotsecpile:
it plots for the case of rectangular pile specifically.

initfree:
it extracts free particles' information for the case of fixed-particle-boundary.

mergeContact:
merge particle contact info from multiple processes and remove redundance.
paraEllip3d no longer outputs multiple data files for contact info, instead, it prints one 
contact info file using parallel IO.

uniqueContact:
remove redundance (unique) in particle contact info.

dupSpecimen:
duplicate specimen in x, y, z directions.

examples of plotting internal contact forces, and all contact forces:
1. for internal_contact:
mkdir internal_contact
uniqueContact deposit_contact 1 500
plotcontact deposit_contact 1 500 1
mv deposit_contact_*.dat internal_contact
cd internal_contact
mypre;rm *.dat

2. for merged_contact:
mkdir merged_contact
uniqueContact deposit_contact 1 500 1
plotcontact deposit_contact 1 500 1
mv deposit_contact_*.dat merged_contact
plot_bdry_contact deposit_bdrycntc 1 500 1
mv deposit_bdrycntc_*.dat merged_contact
cd merged_contact
plotcontactall deposit_contact deposit_bdrycntc 1 500 1
rm deposit_contact_[0-9][0-9][0-9].dat deposit_bdrycntc_*.dat
mypre;rm *.dat

3. example of plotting contact tetrahedra:
uniqueContact deposit_contact 1 100
cp -pr deposit_contact* tetra_contact/dat
cd tetra_contact/dat
plotcontact deposit_contact 1 100 1
rm deposit_contact_[0-9][0-9][0-9]
plot_contact_tetra deposit_contact 1 100 1
mkdir ../tetra
mv *tetra.dat ../tetra
cd ../tetra
mypre;rm *.dat
