How to use ellip3d

1. compile

   1) edit main.cpp for your specific simulation type and parameters
   2) edit parameter.cpp to change more parameters if necessary
   3) edit makefile to toggle on/off OPENMP from OPTION
   4) make
   5) copy ellip3d, main.cpp, parameter.cpp to your simulation directory

2. run

   serial mode: ./ellip3d &

   openmp mode: ./ellip3d -j n &, where n is the number of threads for 
   parallel computing, it is recommended n=4 or n=6 for the best 
   combination of speedup/efficiency. This command line argument bypasses 
   the need to export OMP_NUM_THREADS=n for environment variable.
