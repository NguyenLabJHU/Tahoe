How to use ellip3d

1. compile

   1) edit main.cpp for your specific simulation type and parameters
   2) edit parameter.cpp to change more parameters if necessary
   3) edit makefile to toggle on/off OPENMP from OPTION (default on)
   4) make
   5) copy ellip3d, main.cpp, parameter.cpp to your simulation directory

2. run

   serial mode: ./ellip3d > timelog &

   openmp mode: ./ellip3d n > timelog &

                where n is the number of threads for parallel computing, 
                it is recommended that n=4 or n=6 for the best balance 
                between speedup and efficiency. This command line argument 
                bypasses the need of environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS,
                which is set by export OMP_NUM_THREADS=n.
