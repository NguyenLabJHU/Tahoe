(1) Step 1: run matlab code to process the ".mat" data to get the particle information, such as centroid, 
principal lengths, and so on. 
(2) Step 2: copy the required information from matlab result in Step 1 to the ".ods" excel file, and then 
tranfer to "grain_ellipsoids.txt", then run "conv_ellipsoid.cpp" to convert the "grain_ellipsoids.txt" to
the input file for ellip3d, i.e. "ellipsoids_input.txt".
(3) Step 3: run "plot.cpp" to process the input file "ellipsoids_input.txt" from Step 2.
