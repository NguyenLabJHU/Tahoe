plot:  
it plots all particles at a time as a snapshot. Animations can be made by combining snapshots.

plotsec:
it plots half of all particles from a cross-sectional perspective. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plotmz:  
it plots each particle as a zone.

plot1pc: (plot-1-particle-contacting) 
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots, however, it plots a neighour only when the neighbour is in contact with
it, so a neighbour may first appear and  then disappear in animation.

plot1pp: (plot-1-particle-possible)
it plots a particle and its possible neighbours as a snapshot. Animations can be made by
combining snapshots.

plot1pmz: (plot-1-particle-multiple_zones)
it plots one particle and its contacting neighbours as a snapshot, each particle being a zone.

plotvec: 
it plots vectors such as force and velocity.

probe1p:
it extracts a particle's information.

probedual:
it extracts contact info between two particles.

plotpile, plotsecpile:
it plots for the case of rectangular pile specifically.

initfree:
it extracts free particles' information for the case of fixed-particle-boundary.
