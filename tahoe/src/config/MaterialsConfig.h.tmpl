/** \file MaterialsConfig.h
 * Configuration of optional components within Tahoe.
 * Sections of the code are included or excluded in the build of Tahoe depending in 
 * this flags in this file and in the file MaterialsConfig.make. Each option has
 * a #define definition in this file and a corresponding directory definition
 * in MaterialsConfig.make. The two items must be set consistently to enable or
 * disable materials models. To enable an option:
 * -# in this file, uncomment the #define statement
 * -# in MaterialsConfig.make, uncomment the macro.
 *
 * The naming convention for the definitions in this file and the macros in
 * MaterialsConfig.make are as follows. For the option [OPTION]:
 * -# the symbol in this file will be [OPTION]
 * -# the macro defining the corresponding source directory will be DIRECTORY_[OPTION]
