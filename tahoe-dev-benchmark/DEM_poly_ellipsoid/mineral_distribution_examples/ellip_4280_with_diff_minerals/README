This example is the simulation of gravity deposition of soil sample with different minerals. 
That is to say individual particles in this sample can have different Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.
How to run:
(1) copy this main.cpp into "tahoe/development/src/elements/DEM_ellip3d/ellip3d-2.0_mineral_distribution"
(2) type "make clean" in the terminal and then "make"
(3) copy the generated "ellip3d" into this directory with the input files
(4) type "qsub run.sh" in the terminal
