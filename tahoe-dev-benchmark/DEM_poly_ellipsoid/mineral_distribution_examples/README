This example is eccentric impact of two poly-ellipsoids with different Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. This eccentric impact happens in a container.
Here the input file is different than the input files for polyEllip3d with the same minerals, Since Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for each particle is added
to the last two variables in the row.
