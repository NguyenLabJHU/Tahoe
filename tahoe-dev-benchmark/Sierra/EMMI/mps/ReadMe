This is a uniaxial deformation test of the approximate calculation of
the velocity gradient. The script do_test.csh does the following:
(1) runs tahoe
(2) extracts the velocity gradient information from the .out file
(3) plots the results using gnuplot

To run the test, set the TAHOE variable in the .csh file to the path to
the tahoe executable.
