xx = nt or is = nasal-temporal or inferior-superior
aa = tissue number: typically three tissues were tested under nominally identical conditions, I have only included
	the data set that was shown in the slide, but I have more if you want them.
b = cycle number for repetitive loading
........ = a date-time stamp that can be ignored
