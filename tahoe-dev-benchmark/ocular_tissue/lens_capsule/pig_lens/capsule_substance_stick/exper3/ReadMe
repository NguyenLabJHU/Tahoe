1) use pstudy.in first to do a parameter study to find a range of parameters from which to attempt to optimize

- to run Dakota in parallel, comment out all clean commands in the .csh file and also uncomment file save commands in the respective dakota .in files; MAKE SURE you do not use more processors than there are parameter increments

- if running Dakota again in parallel, clean out all files manually (i.e., using rm) in the respective directory: 

rm -f dakota* error_func.in.* error_func.out.* idr-parsed-input.txt

- to run in batch mode, comment out the graphics command in the .in file, and type

mpirun -np 4 dakota -i pstudy.in >& dakota.log &

2) then run patsearch.in to optimize once in a region of parameters with local minima
