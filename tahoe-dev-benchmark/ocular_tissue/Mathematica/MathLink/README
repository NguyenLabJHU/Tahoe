1) edit compare.nb for your specific model and output as  Mathematica v2
2) edit the M v2 file to get rid of "font" and enclosing comments and rename
  file as "compare.m" (see example)
3) compile "math_handler.c" 
  mcc math_handler.c -o math_handler
4) run dakota after editing "compare.dakota" for ranges
  dakota -i compare.dakota
