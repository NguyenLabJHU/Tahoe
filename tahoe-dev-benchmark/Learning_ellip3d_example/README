This is an example for learning the ellip3d. 
The simulation is cavity expansion, in which some particles near the center of the container will be 
expanded at the beginning, causing very large contact forces which drives the simulation.

(1) Compile the code
Copy main.cpp to "./ellip3d-2.0", then type "make" in the terminal to compile the code. The default compiler is gcc.

(2) Run the simulation
Copy the generated "ellip3d" to the working directory, the same directory as this README file.
Now, you may type "ellip3d 8 > exp_out" in the terminal or you can "qsub run.sh" if you are in soilblast/soilblast2.
Here "8" is the number of threads you want to use, this can be blank that means only run serial.
"> exp_out" means save the screen printout to "./exp_out".

(3) Post-process
After the simulation finished, you will have "exp_particle_*", where "*" can from 000 to end.
we will then convert these particle files to the tecplot format by "plot.cpp".
First, compile "plot.cpp" by typing "g++ -o plot plot.cpp" depends on your c++ compiler.
Then, type "plot exp_particle 0 100 1", you will get "exp_particle_*.dat".
Here "0 100 1" means convert the files from exp_particle_000 to exp_particle_100 with increment as 1.
Third, type "tecplot exp_particle*.dat" if you are in soilblast/soilblast2.
