This folder is the input files and results for the cavity expansion with granular stress and strain calculation based on RVE domain, which is used in the paper.
Note that the cavity simulation is the same as the one without RVE stress and strain calculation.
During this simulation, the ellip3d will re-generate tessellation using Qhull at every 1000 time steps.

To run this simulation, you type:
ellip3d 4 > exp_out &

or janus-long:
qsub -q janus-long run.sh
