This is code is to calculate the granular strain measures for soil samples in experiments.
Generally speaking, the code will divide the sample into many overlaped RVEs, and the strain measures
are calculated for these RVEs. Note that this code did not run DEM, it is just post-process.

(1) The variables in main.cpp to define the size of the sample and to control the size of the RVEs 
    a, xmin = 1732.8;  xmax = 13867.02;	// the coordinates of the computational domain
       ymin = 1894.1;  ymax =13746.81 ;
       zmin = -20720.4;  zmax = -2621.5;
       These variables are the dimensions of the soil sample in experiments.
    b, REAL RVE_size = 6000;	// the size of the RVE
       REAL RVE_inter = 0.2*RVE_size;	// the space interval of two neighbor RVE
       These two variables are used to control the size of the RVE, and the length interval between two neighboring RVEs.
       One can also extend this code to have different size in xyz directions and different length intervals in different directions.

(2) To run the code, we need also to go to calculateGranularStrain() in assembly.cpp to specify the time at different snapshots
    time_interval[0] = 60;	// 1 minutes
    time_interval[1] = 60;
    time_interval[2] = 90;
    time_interval[3] = 90;
    time_interval[4] = 60;
    time_interval[5] = 120;
    time_interval[6] = 120;
    time_interval[7] = 180;
    The soil sample in this current example has 8 snapshots, these above time_interval's are used to define the time interval between
    two snapshots. Here snapshots means the experiment gets the CT image and extracts sand grains' information.

(3) Format of the input file, i.e. "F35_15.txt" in this example

    (number of the sand grain)        x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... xi yi zi ... (volume of the sand grain)
    (number of the sand grain)        x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... xi yi zi ... (volume of the sand grain)
    ...

    Each row corresponds the information for a different sand grain. Here xi,yi,zi are the coordinates of the sand grain at snapshot i.
    The input file should be in the same folder as the executable file, i.e. "strainCalculator".
