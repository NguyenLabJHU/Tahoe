Things that needed to be addressed when running the code through f2c
(1) The source fortran files were modified so that local variable Cray
    pointers where re-written into the argument list so their dynamic
	dimensions could be set with the DIMENSION statement.

(2) When freeing these variables, you need to be careful to undo any
    pointer offsets that f2c produces.

(3) all calls to functions in libf2c.a where replaced with calls to normal
	C functions.

(4) look out for calls to abs(), which should be fabs. Comparisons between
    fabs(), .i.e, if (fabs(a) > fabs(b)) don't seem to work properly.
