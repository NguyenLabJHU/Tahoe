# Configuration of optional components within Tahoe.
# Sections of the code are included or excluded in the build of Tahoe depending in 
# this flags in this file and in the file SolidMaterialsConfig.h. Each option has
# a #define definition in SolidMaterialsConfig.h and a corresponding directory definition
# in this file. The two items must be set consistently to enable or
# disable materials models. To enable an option:
# -# in this file, uncomment the macro.
# -# in SolidMaterialsConfig.h, uncomment the #define statement
#
# The naming convention for the definitions in this file and the macros in
# SolidMaterialsConfig.h are as follows. For the option [OPTION]:
# -# the macro below defining the corresponding source directory will be DIRECTORY_[OPTION]
# -# the symbol in SolidMaterialsConfig.h file will be [OPTION]
