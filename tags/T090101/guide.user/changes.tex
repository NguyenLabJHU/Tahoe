\subsection{Changes since Version 3.4}
\label{sect.changes.log}
This section summarizes changes to the \tahoe input format
since Version 3.4.
\subsubsection{update 3.4.1}
Two additional output variables have been added to the element output 
for solid deformation elements listed in 
Table~\ref{tab.solid.output.element}. This brings the number of 
element output flags from 5 to 7. This change is version aware. Only 5 
flags are read if the input file version is older than 3.4.1.
