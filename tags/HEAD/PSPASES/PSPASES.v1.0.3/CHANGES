--- Changes in version 1.0.3 from version 1.0.2 (May 9, 1999)

1. PSPASES communicator was re-designed to fix a memory bug. This bug 
   made it impossible to recover the memory consumed by multiple numerical
   factorizations performed via DPSPACEN call. In the new design, the calling
   interface to DPSPACEN has changed. There are three types of PSPASES
   communicators depending on which call generates that communicator. Calls
   to DPSPACEN and DPSPACET accept only specific types of communicator.
   Refer to the updated manual in DOC subdirectory for further details.
   The example codes pspases_testc.c, pspases_testfr.f, and pspases_testfc.f
   in TEST subdirectory have been modified to illustrate the use of new 
   communicator.

2. Users who tried to port PSPASES to platforms such as DEC, Sun, or Linux 
   PCs saw some compilation warnings in files "premovea.f", "emovea.f", 
   "serialfactor.f", and "parfact1i.f". These have been taken care of.
   Some users, who used older version (1.0) of MPICH, were facing "Invalid
   Communicator" problem in C-driver routine in TEST subdirectory. This has
   also been taken care of.

3. A prototype file "cpspases.h" is provided. This file will help in checking
   correct parameter passing (number and type) to PSPASES subroutines from
   C applications.

4. Some changes to Makefile to give guidelines for building the library on 
   SUN Solaris platforms. 

--- Changes in version 1.0.2 from version 1.0.1 (Sept 25, 1998)

1. ParMETIS and METIS codes are new. The latest ParMETIS version 2.0 supplied
   at the METIS site (http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis) is used. Some minor changes
   made to this standard distribution are listed in METIS.note file. The new
   version has different function names and calling sequences for serial and
   parallel ordering codes, so appropriate changes in PSPASES files have been
   made.

2. Some minor changes in Makefiles.

--- Changes in version 1.0.1 from version 1.0 (June 1, 1998)

1. Now PSPASES functions work on a private copy of the MPI communicator
   being passed to them. This way, the routines are not affected by any
   communications pending on the input MPI communicator.

2. Made some minor modifications to User's manual (Section 5).

3. Added some notes to "testrun" script in TEST directory.

--- Changes in version 1.0 from version 0.0beta (May 23, 1998)

1. Fixed problems related to boundary cases, such as relatively small size
   of matrices for given number of processors, and diagonal matrices. 
   Changes were made to PSPASES and Metis code, and the driver codes.

2. Added support for four different formats (.fcc, .bin, .rsa HB, .rsa RB).
   Drivers are provided for all these formats in TEST directory.
   Note: The previous spd format is now renamed fcc format.

3. Added README.USAGE file explaining some usage related issues, and the
   formats, and changed README.INSTALL file.

4. Simpler testing interface is now available via improved Makefile and a 
   "testrun" script in TEST directory.

5. Created matrices directory which has representative matrices in four
   formats.

6. Metis code is now version 3.0.6 code with some more fixes in ometispar.c
   and sfm.c.
