Output the mesh to specified format such as ensight, 
exodus or paradyn

File MakeCrystal.cpp is a good example of how to use
bravais.

Many input files are provided to help user:

data :  test 2D cells
data2:  test 3D cells

data3:  test 2D length
data4:  test 3D length

data5:  test 2D rotation of atoms in box
data6:  test 3D rotation of atoms in box

data7:  test 2D rotation of box of atoms
data8:  test 3D rotation of box of atoms

data9:  test 2D sort one criterion 
data10: test 3D sort one criterion 


To be done:
 	- Add benchmarks
	- Sort with two criteria
