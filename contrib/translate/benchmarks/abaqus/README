abq5821.inp - Abaqus version 5.8-21 input deck used to generate results file 
abq5821.fil - Binary abaqus results file
abq5821.fin - ASCII abaqus results file, converted using ascfil
     - 5 time steps
     - 6 DOF displacement as node variables
     - 3 components of stress tensor as quadrature variables
     - 1 pressure load as element variable
     - 33 node sets
     - 1681 nodes, not consecutively numbered
     - shell elements - AbaqusResultsT reads as Quads
     - 6 element sets

I don't know if the binary *fil file is platform independent, I think so, but
I don't trust abaqus, until I see it.
